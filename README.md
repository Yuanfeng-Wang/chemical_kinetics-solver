# kinetics-solver
Implicit Trapezoidal with Newton's Method ( used for solving chemical kinetics ). The method works best for mildly stiff problems.
Name of the solver is Trapsol.
jacob_function.m generates the functions from the differential equations which is required for jacob_fn.m to calculate the JACOBIAN matrix.

A demo of solving differential equations is also provided.(eqns.m contains differential equations for solving in demo.m)
